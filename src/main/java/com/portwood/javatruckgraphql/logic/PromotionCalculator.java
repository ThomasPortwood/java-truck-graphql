     *
     * sends the customer for every 11th order a coupon for a free chocolate (coupon A),
     *
     * the customer for every 17th order a coupon for a free pastry (coupon B ).
     *
     * For an order that matches both of these criteria (i.e. is an 11th order as well as a 17th order),
     * they receive a special gold coupon for a 12-pack of bonbons (coupon C).
     *
     * You can define the format of the input (for example, it could be order numbers, tuples, order objects, JSON strings - whatever you prefer),
     * and the output should be a single value that indicates which coupon the customer should get. Submit the code.
